Thanks to Rastignac, dlc.sh now updates the /var/mobile/supported_dlc.txt list of apps when you press the Supported Apps button.

LevelUnlocker's /var/mobile/supported_levelunlocker.txt is updated by the script, as long as Ramsey uses the edit I made to it.


-Changelog-
1.0: Initial release.
1.1: Added navbar, proper supported apps listing.
1.2: Added control Depends for Erica Utilites and an in-app check for it.

Over 9000 internets to cybot2006 for the name, icon and UI design.

-Updating Scripts-
Download the scripts from the above Hackulous threads, save them as 'dlc.sh' and 'levelunlocker.sh', in UNIX format, and SSH them into the /Applications/haxie.app folder. :)
