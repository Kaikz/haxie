Thanks to Rastignac, dlc.sh now updates the /var/mobile/supported_dlc.txt list of apps when you press the Supported Apps button.

LevelUnlocker's /var/mobile/supported_levelunlocker.txt is updated by the script, as long as Ramsey uses the edit I made to it.


-Changelog-
1.0: Initial release.
1.1: Added navbar, proper supported apps listing.
1.2: Added control Depends for Erica Utilites and an in-app check for it.
1.3: Added annoying UIDickBar.
1.4: Updated dlc.sh to v0.4.9 (2011-02-28), LevelUnlocker to 0.3.1, replaced navbars with UIDickBars, tab 'em for more info, removed (i) info buttons, changed supported apps button to go to Hackulous threads.

Over 9000 internets to cybot2006 for the name, icon and UI design.

-Updating Scripts-
Download the scripts from the above Hackulous threads, save them as 'dlc.sh' and 'levelunlocker.sh', in UNIX format, and SSH them into the /Applications/haxie.app folder. :)
